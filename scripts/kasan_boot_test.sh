# kasan_boot_test.sh -- boots a KASAN + lockdep instrumented linux-6.12
# kernel in a VM (via virtme-ng), loads the real anticheat.ko into it,
# exercises the daemon CLI plus the real (non-safe-mode) ioctl fuzz
# harness against the real /dev/anticheat, and fails if the console/
# dmesg output shows a KASAN report, a lockdep splat, or any oops/
# warning/general-protection-fault during the run.
#
# This is the "real" run test/ioctl_fuzz.c's own header comment and
# README's "ioctl fuzzing" section describe as the one that actually
# closes the kernel-assurance gap: CI's per-push dry run only proves the
# harness itself is correct against the mock, which has none of a real
# kernel's copy_from_user()/access_ok() to stress.
#
# Needs: a Linux host, ideally with KVM available (falls back to much
# slower QEMU/TCG software emulation if not -- see
# .github/workflows/kasan-boot.yml, which runs this nightly rather than
# per-push for exactly that reason: GitHub-hosted runners don't reliably
# offer /dev/kvm), virtme-ng ("pipx install virtme-ng" -- recent distros
# mark the system Python as externally-managed, so plain `pip install`
# outside a venv typically fails), qemu-system-x86, and the usual kernel
# build deps (bc flex bison libelf-dev libssl-dev dwarves).
#
# Run locally: ./scripts/kasan_boot_test.sh
# Override the fuzz run via environment: IOCTL_FUZZ_ITERATIONS=2000
# IOCTL_FUZZ_SEED=$(date +%s) ./scripts/kasan_boot_test.sh -- the fixed
# defaults below keep a bare local invocation reproducible; the nightly
# workflow passes a fresh seed each run instead, so repeated nightly
# runs accumulate coverage rather than re-fuzzing the identical sequence
# forever.
