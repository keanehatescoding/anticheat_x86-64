# kernel-anticheat

A Linux kernel-mode anticheat: a loadable kernel module (LKM) that performs
kernel-level integrity checks and enforces process protection, plus a
userspace daemon/CLI that talks to it over a small ioctl interface
(`/dev/anticheat`).

> **Purpose:** defensive security instrumentation. It detects tampering with
> the running kernel (syscall hooks, hidden modules) and with protected
> processes (RWX code caves, debugger attaches, runtime code patching).
> It is **not** designed to bypass any protection.

### Kernel module features

1. **Syscall table discovery + integrity.** The module locates
   `sys_call_table` without `kallsyms_lookup_name` (not exported since 5.7):
   it resolves the `__x64_sys_read`/`__x64_sys_write` handler addresses with
   kprobes, then scans the kernel image for the 8-byte slot equal to the read
   handler and cross-validates with the write handler. Every table entry is
   then checked to lie inside the core kernel text (`[_stext, _etext)`) and
   outside any loaded module — the classic rootkit hook (redirecting a
   syscall into module/vmalloc memory) is flagged and reported as
   `AC_EV_SYSCALL_HOOK`. Separately, every handler address is snapshotted
   and SHA-256-checksummed once at module load; each later check (periodic,
   or on demand via `anticheat syscalls`) recomputes the checksum and
   compares per-slot against that boot baseline, flagging an entry whose
   handler changed while still passing the core-text check as
   `AC_EV_SYSCALL_REDIRECT` — an in-text redirect (e.g. sys_read →
   sys_write) that the range check alone can't see (see #63).

2. **Module enumeration.** The kernel-internal module list is walked
   (preemption disabled, since `module_mutex` is not exported) and compared
   by the daemon against `/proc/modules`, detecting modules hidden from
   procfs.

3. **Protected process registry.** Processes are registered by pid; the
   registry stores `task_struct` references (namespace-safe, immune to pid
   reuse). **Protection is inherited by forked children** (tracked with a
   kretprobe on `kernel_clone`).

4. **ptrace denial.** A kprobe on `__x64_sys_ptrace` (and the ia32 entry)
   intercepts attach/debug requests against protected processes. The request
   argument is rewritten to an invalid value, so the syscall fails cleanly
   with `-EIO` and has **no side effects** (the attach never happens). Per
   policy (`ac_policy` bit 0, default on) the offending tracer is also
   SIGKILLed from a private workqueue (safe from atomic kprobe context).
   `process_vm_readv`/`process_vm_writev` — the standard way to read or
   write another process's memory without ever calling `ptrace(2)` — get
   the same treatment via their own kprobes (native and ia32 entries): the
   pid argument is rewritten to an invalid value, so the syscall fails
   cleanly with `-ESRCH` before touching a single byte of the protected
   process's memory, and the same kill policy applies.

5. **Fork / exec / exit tracing.** kretprobe on `kernel_clone` (inheritance +
   events), kprobe pre-handlers on `do_exit` and `__x64_sys_execve[at]`/
   `__ia32_compat_sys_execve[at]` (execve/execveat have distinct compat
   syscall definitions, so the ia32 syscall table entry is the compat
   wrapper, not the generic ia32 stub). Fork inheritance and exec tracing
   key off thread-group membership, not the exact registered `task_struct`,
   so a worker thread of a protected process that calls `fork()`/`execve()`
   is covered too.

6. **VMA memory scan.** A snapshot of the process address space is built
   under the mmap read lock (maple-tree iterator) and served to userspace
   via begin/get/end ioctls (kept under the 14-bit ioctl size limit).
   Executable+writable ("RWX code cave") mappings are flagged — the classic
   runtime code-injection signature. Executable mappings with **no backing
   file at all** are flagged too (`AC_EV_ANON_EXEC`): legitimate code is
   always backed by a file (the binary or a shared library), so this also
   catches the write-then-`mprotect(R-X)` pattern, where shellcode is
   written to a RW mapping and then made executable — W and X are never
   both set at the same instant, so it never trips the RWX check. `vdso`
   and `vvar` legitimately show up in this category too (present from
   process start, never changing); the daemon's periodic scan tracks each
   protected pid's count from when it was first observed and only alerts
   on a *later increase*, so those don't generate noise (see
   `anon_baseline_check()` in the daemon).

7. **Event ring buffer.** Fixed-size ring of security events consumed by the
   daemon (`events`, and periodically by `start`).

8. **Module pinning.** While the daemon holds `/dev/anticheat` open (or after
   `anticheat lock`), `rmmod` fails with `EBUSY`.

```

The daemon (`start`) protects its own pid on startup (so it can't just be
ptrace-attached or debugged away — see `AC_IOCTL_ADD_PROC` in `cmd_start`),
runs the same VM/hypervisor check as `vmcheck` once at startup (logged,
not re-polled — unlike the other periodic checks below, whether the OS
itself is virtualized can't change mid-session), polls security events,
re-checks syscall integrity every 5 s, module
visibility every 10 s, scans protected processes every 30 s (override via
`AC_SCAN_CHECK_INTERVAL`) for RWX mappings and for anonymous-executable
mappings appearing *after* a process was first observed (each pid's
baseline count is recorded on first scan;
`vdso`/`vvar` never trigger since they're present from process start and
never change — see `anon_baseline_check()`), and every 60 s re-hashes every
protected process's executable, file-backed mappings against whatever
baseline was already saved for them via `--hash --save`
(`check_baselines_periodic()`). It never creates a baseline on its own —
only an operator running `--save` on a binary they've already verified
clean does that — so a process with no saved baseline is silently skipped,
not auto-trusted. Every 30 s (override via `AC_RENDER_HOOK_CHECK_INTERVAL`)
it also re-checks every protected process for the same
`vkQueuePresentKHR` inline-hook this checks for on demand via `scan
--check-hooks` (`check_render_hooks_periodic()`) — silent unless it
actually finds a hook, same as the baseline/anon-exec checks, since a
clean result every cycle for every protected process would be log noise
rather than signal. Every 10 s (override via
`AC_LD_PRELOAD_CHECK_INTERVAL` / `AC_VK_LAYER_CHECK_INTERVAL` respectively)
it also checks each newly-protected process's `LD_PRELOAD`
(`check_ld_preload_periodic()`) and Vulkan-layer-activation environment
variables (`check_vk_layers_periodic()`) — see below; unlike the other
periodic checks these warn **at most once per pid**, since
`/proc/<pid>/environ` is fixed at `exec()` time and re-warning about the
same unchanging values every cycle forever would be pure noise. Every
30 s (override via `AC_IMPLICIT_LAYER_CHECK_INTERVAL`) it also re-scans
each protected process's *implicit* Vulkan layer manifests
(`check_implicit_layers_periodic()`) — see below; this one re-checks every
cycle rather than once per pid (manifest files can change while a session
is running, unlike environ), but only warns on a *growth* in the
unrecognized-layer count for a pid, same baseline-delta design as
anon-exec detection above. Alerts go to syslog (`LOG_AUTH`) and
`/var/log/anticheat.log`.

Baselines are stored in `/var/lib/anticheat/baselines/` (one file per path,
named by a SHA-256 of the path; override the directory with the
`AC_BASELINE_DIR` environment variable, up to 256 segment records per
file). Within that file, each file-backed executable mapping gets its
own record, keyed by `(inode, file offset, size)` rather than path alone
— a library with more than one executable `PT_LOAD` segment gets one
independently-tracked record per segment instead of the last `--save`
silently overwriting the others, and two mappings that happen to share a
starting file offset at different lengths don't evict each other either.
A mapping at a known `(inode, offset)` whose size no longer matches (e.g.
the file was rebuilt at the same path) is treated as having no
compatible baseline rather than hashed against a stale digest, and
reported as such so an operator knows to re-run `--save`, same treatment
given to a baseline saved by a daemon build predating per-segment
records (pre-#51) and detected as a legacy, unreadable format. `--check`
reports mappings whose runtime content differs from their segment's
baseline — a strong signal of runtime code patching. `--save` itself is
written via a same-directory temp file + `rename()` under an `flock()`
held on the target file, so a write error, a killed process, or two
concurrent `--save` runs against the same path can't corrupt or drop
another segment's already-saved record; a file already holding 256
*other* segments' records fails the save outright rather than silently
dropping it.

### Render-hook detection (Vulkan + GLX/OpenGL + EGL present-call)

`scan --pid N --check-hooks` checks for the classic ESP/overlay/aimbot
technique of inline-hooking the graphics API's frame-present call. It
checks **every** rendering API a Linux game is realistically using:
`vkQueuePresentKHR` in `libvulkan.so` (native Vulkan games, and Proton
D3D9/10/11/12 titles too, since DXVK/VKD3D-Proton translate D3D calls down
to Vulkan), `glXSwapBuffers` in `libGL.so` (native OpenGL games, and older
Proton titles still on wined3d's GL backend instead of DXVK), and
`eglSwapBuffers` in `libEGL.so` (anything using EGL instead of GLX to
create its GL/GLES context — increasingly common under Wayland, and for
GLES-based engines). A process only using one or two of the three cleanly
reports the rest as "not loaded", not an error — most processes only ever
have one mapped.

This needs no signature database and can't go stale across distros or
driver/loader versions: the daemon reads the *exact same on-disk file*
the target process has mapped, parses its ELF section headers directly to
find the target symbol's file-relative offset, and compares its bytes
against the same offset read from the target's memory (`/proc/<pid>/mem`,
the same mechanism `--hash` already uses — see
`compare_render_symbol()`/`elf_find_symbol_offset()` in the daemon, and
`render_hook_status_for()`/`find_lib_by_basename()` for the
library/symbol-parameterized lookup all three APIs share). A classic
inline/trampoline hook — patching the function's bytes to jump into
injected code — changes those bytes; an unmodified process matches
byte-for-byte. The reference copy is whatever the target itself is
currently using, read fresh at check time, so there's nothing to maintain
as Mesa/NVIDIA driver or Vulkan loader versions change.

**Compares the symbol's whole declared length, not a fixed guess.** The
ELF symbol table carries each function's actual size (`st_size`); the
check reads and compares exactly that many bytes (clamped to
`[AC_HOOK_CHECK_MIN_BYTES, AC_HOOK_CHECK_MAX_BYTES]` = `[8, 512]`, or a
32-byte default if a symbol's size is unavailable) instead of a fixed
window that could either miss a hook placed further into a longer
function, or — as a real earlier version of this check did — read a few
bytes *past* a short one into whatever follows it. Verified against real
data before relying on it: `glXSwapBuffers` is 17 bytes on a real system
(smaller than the old fixed 32-byte window), `vkQueuePresentKHR` is 81.
`test.sh` proves the actual capability this unlocks, not just that
byte-0 hooks still work: it self-hooks `vkQueuePresentKHR` at offset 40
— past where the old fixed window would have looked — and confirms the
scan still flags it. `st_size` comes from the same
attacker-influenceable file as everything else this check reads, so it's
bounded, never trusted as authoritative on its own.

Deliberately never `dlopen()`s that file, and this isn't a style
preference: the path is resolved through the *target's own* mount
namespace (see below), which isn't a trusted input — a process can be set
up so an attacker controls what's mounted at the path the kernel reports
for it. `dlopen()` would run that file's constructors as root. The ELF
symbol table is parsed with plain `pread()` instead, so no code from an
untrusted file is ever executed — verified directly, not just reasoned
about: a constructor planted in a file at an attacker-controlled
mount-namespace path does not run when the check reads it.

Known blind spot, not a bug: this catches in-place byte patching of the
exported function, not a cheat that intercepts the call via `LD_PRELOAD`
symbol interposition or a malicious Vulkan layer — those never touch the
target symbol's actual bytes (neither GLX nor EGL has a layer system, so
that specific gap is Vulkan-only; LD_PRELOAD interposition applies to all
three APIs equally). `--check-preload` and `--check-vklayers` below
partially cover both cases, as heuristic signals, not verdicts — see the
environment-variable-only caveat on the Vulkan-layer one specifically.
Also known and not yet covered: hooks placed inside DXVK/VKD3D's own
translation-layer code (rather than in `libvulkan.so` itself) or in the
Vulkan loader's internal dispatch table (rather than the exported symbol)
are both invisible to a check that only verifies the exported symbol's own
bytes. A symbol with no size info in the ELF symbol table (stripped or
unusual builds) falls back to the old 32-byte default window, so a
sufficiently deep detour into an unsized symbol could still be missed.

**Mount-namespace aware.** The kernel-side VMA scan reports a path
string for the target's library; opening that string directly from the
daemon's own (host) mount namespace would trust that whatever exists
there is the same file the target actually has mapped, which isn't
guaranteed for a process in a container/sandbox with a private
bind-mount at that path (Flatpak, Steam Runtime). The daemon instead
opens it through `/proc/<pid>/root/<path>`, which the kernel resolves
exactly as the target process itself sees it — for a target sharing the
daemon's own namespace (the common case), `/proc/<pid>/root` is just
`/`, so this is a strict correctness fix with no downside there. Verified
empirically, not assumed: without this, a private bind-mount shadowing
an otherwise-identical host path silently produced the wrong reference
bytes (or an unopenable file) and the check could only report
"inconclusive"; through `/proc/<pid>/root/` it correctly loads the real,
target-visible library and compares it properly. `test/mount_ns_probe.c`
+ a real `unshare --mount` namespace in `test.sh` exercise this directly
against a real loaded module, not just in theory.

`scan --check-hooks` is the on-demand, human-facing form; the same
detection also runs automatically every 30 s against every protected
process from the `start` monitoring loop (see above) — a hook installed
mid-session gets caught without anyone running a manual scan.
`test/render_hook_test.c` proves the detection itself works (self-hooks a
given library/symbol pair — `vkQueuePresentKHR`/`libvulkan.so.1` by
default, or any other pair via `argv[1]`/`argv[2]`, e.g.
`glXSwapBuffers`/`libGL.so.1` or `eglSwapBuffers`/`libEGL.so.1` — in a
throwaway process), and `test.sh` exercises all three APIs separately: the
one-shot `scan --check-hooks` path and the periodic monitoring-loop path,
against a real loaded module, for each of Vulkan, GLX/OpenGL, and EGL.

### LD_PRELOAD and Vulkan-layer detection

`scan --pid N --check-preload` and `scan --pid N --check-vklayers` both
read a process's `/proc/<pid>/environ` for specific variables and report
them if set. Together these close the two documented render-hook blind
spots above: a cheat that intercepts `vkQueuePresentKHR` via library
interposition or a Vulkan layer, rather than inline-patching bytes, never
shows up in the render-hook check, since neither ever touches the target
function's actual code — but both require setting something in the
process's environment to get loaded in the first place, with one
exception, closed separately below: an *implicit* Vulkan layer needs no
environment variable at all.

`--check-preload` looks for `LD_PRELOAD`. `--check-vklayers` looks for
`VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS`/`VK_LOADER_LAYERS_ENABLE` (force-enabling a layer by
name — the older and current Vulkan loader mechanisms respectively) and
`VK_LAYER_PATH`/`VK_ADD_LAYER_PATH` (pointing the loader at additional
manifest directories, which is how an attacker's own layer becomes
discoverable at all) — both share one internal primitive
(`ac_read_environ_vars()`) that reads `environ` once and checks every
candidate name in the same pass, rather than reopening the file per
variable.

`environ` is read directly rather than trusted from anywhere the process
itself could have relabeled at runtime: it's populated once by the kernel
at `exec()` and never updated by the process's own later `setenv()`
calls, so this reflects what the process actually launched with.

**Deliberately heuristics, not verdicts.** `MangoHud`, `gamemode`,
`gamescope`, and plenty of other completely legitimate tools use both
`LD_PRELOAD` and Vulkan layers routinely — MangoHud's overlay *is* a
Vulkan layer. A game running with an FPS overlay or a compatibility shim
is normal, not suspicious, and both checks say so explicitly in their
output rather than framing every hit as an alert. In the periodic
monitoring loop both log at `LOG_WARNING`, not `LOG_ALERT`/`LOG_CRIT` —
which matters beyond just log severity: the ban-pipeline auto-report hook
in `logmsg()` only fires at `LOG_ALERT`/`LOG_CRIT`, so a detection here is
visible to an operator in the log but does **not** by itself accumulate as
a report against a `client_id`. It's a fact for a human reviewing other
evidence to correlate against, the same design instinct as anon-exec
detection flagging presence rather than passing judgment.

`test.sh` exercises both checks the same way: a negative case (a plain
victim process reports nothing set) and a positive case (a victim
launched with the relevant variable set to something harmless — for
`LD_PRELOAD`, its own libc, inert since the dynamic linker already loads
it regardless; for `VK_LAYER_PATH`, `/tmp`, since the check only reads the
variable's value and never invokes the Vulkan loader) through both the
one-shot `scan` path and the periodic monitoring-loop path, against a real
loaded module.

### Implicit Vulkan-layer manifest detection

`--check-vklayers` only covers the environment-variable activation path.
An *implicit* Vulkan layer manifest dropped directly into one of the
loader's default search directories is auto-enabled with no environment
variable involved at all — exactly what `scan --pid N --check-implicit-layers`
closes, by directly replicating what the Vulkan loader itself does:
enumerate the same directories it searches — both the target user's own
per-user paths (`~/.config/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`,
`~/.local/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/` — the more realistic injection
vector, since writing there needs no elevated privilege at all) and the
system-wide ones (`/etc/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`,
`/usr/share/vulkan/implicit_layer.d/`, and their `/usr/local/...`
counterparts) — parse each `*.json` manifest found, and cross-reference
against the target's own `environ` (reusing `ac_read_environ_vars()`) to
determine whether each discovered layer is actually active for that
specific process right now: present, and not disabled via its own
`disable_environment` variable (if the manifest defines one).

Since the daemon runs as root but the target runs as its own user, the
per-user paths are resolved against *that user's* home directory — read
from `/proc/<pid>/status`'s `Uid:` line, then `getpwuid_r()` — not root's
own `$HOME`, which would silently miss the entire per-user vector.

**Manifests are parsed, never executed, and never trusted as well-formed.**
This is exactly the kind of file the check exists to be suspicious of, so
`json_extract_string()`/`json_extract_disable_env()` are a small, targeted
extractor for the specific fields this schema needs (`name`,
`library_path`, and the single key inside `disable_environment`'s nested
object) — not a general JSON parser, bounded and defensive throughout, the
same posture as `elf_find_symbol_offset()` in the render-hook check.
Nothing from a discovered layer's `library_path` is ever opened or loaded,
only reported. Verified directly, not just reasoned about: a truncated,
syntactically-broken manifest and 500 bytes of raw random data dropped in
the same directory don't crash or hang the check, they're just skipped.

**A small, explicitly non-exhaustive allowlist** of common legitimate
overlay/vendor layer name prefixes (MangoHud, `vkBasalt`, RenderDoc,
LatencyFleX, Steam's overlay and Fossilize layers, and the GPU-vendor/Khronos
layers Mesa/NVIDIA/AMD/Intel ship) keeps the periodic check from warning on
every machine that happens to have a normal Linux gaming setup — verified
against a real one: this machine's actual installed Steam and Mesa layer
manifests were used to catch (and fix) a case-sensitivity bug in the
allowlist before it shipped, not just a synthetic test. This is a
name-based heuristic, not a security boundary — a cheat could name its own
layer `VK_LAYER_MANGOHUD_overlay` to blend in — so the one-shot CLI check
reports every active layer regardless of the allowlist, precisely so a
human reviewing it isn't relying on the name check alone.

**Periodic check re-scans every cycle, not once per pid.** Unlike the
environ-based checks above, manifest files live on disk and can change
while a session is already running, so treating environ's "fixed at
exec()" logic as an excuse to check once wouldn't be correct here. Instead
it reuses `anon_baseline_check()`'s exact design: whatever unrecognized
layers are already active the first time a pid is observed become that
pid's baseline, silently, and only a *later increase* — a new
unrecognized layer appearing mid-session — is the signal worth a
`LOG_WARNING`. `test.sh` proves this baseline-then-growth behavior
directly: protects a victim with no manifest present yet, confirms the
periodic check logs nothing on its first pass, drops the manifest in
while the daemon is still running, and confirms the very next cycle logs
it.

`test.sh` also proves the full mechanism against a real user's real
`$HOME` (via `$SUDO_USER`, since this all needs to run as root but
resolve a *different* user's paths to mean anything): the negative case,
the positive case, `disable_environment` suppression, and the periodic
baseline/growth behavior, all against a real loaded module.

### VM/hypervisor detection

`anticheat vmcheck` checks whether the OS itself (not any specific
process) is running inside a virtual machine — cheat authors routinely
develop and test inside a VM specifically to keep their real hardware
unbanned, or run the target game itself in one to reverse-engineer this
project in a disposable environment. This is deliberately a system-wide,
one-shot check: unlike the process-specific, continuously-repeated checks
above, whether the OS is virtualized is a fact about the machine as a
whole that can't change mid-session, so `cmd_start()` runs it once at
startup and logs the result rather than polling it on a timer.

Two independent, purely userspace signals, needing no kernel module
involvement at all — CPUID and `/sys/class/dmi/id/` both already return
the real, authoritative hardware/firmware answer to any process on the
machine, so routing this through `anticheat_module.c` would add ioctl
surface for no security benefit:

- **CPUID hypervisor-present bit** (leaf 1, ECX bit 31) — the standard
  signal essentially every hypervisor sets by default. If set, leaf
  `0x40000000`'s EBX/ECX/EDX (only architecturally defined once the
  presence bit is set) give a 12-character vendor ID string identifying
  which one — `KVMKVMKVM\0\0\0`, `VMwareVMware`, `VBoxVBoxVBox`,
  `Microsoft Hv`, `XenVMMXenVMM`, `TCGTCGTCGTCG` (QEMU's own software CPU
  emulation, distinct from KVM-accelerated QEMU), `prl hyperv␠␠`
  (Parallels), `bhyve bhyve␠` (where `␠` denotes an ASCII space — spaces
  are part of these vendor ID strings, but literal trailing spaces
  inside a code span are stripped/ambiguous in Markdown rendering).
  `__cpuid()` is used rather than the leaf-range-checked
  `__get_cpuid()` deliberately — leaf `0x40000000` is
  a hypervisor-reserved leaf, not a standard one, and the checked
  function would refuse to read past whatever leaf 0 reports as the max
  standard leaf.
- **DMI/SMBIOS strings** (`sys_vendor`, `product_name`, `board_vendor`
  under `/sys/class/dmi/id/`, typically world-readable) — a corroborating
  signal, not authoritative on its own, that also catches a hypervisor
  that masks the CPUID leaf above but leaves default BIOS/DMI strings in
  place. `Microsoft Corporation` is matched only in combination with a
  `product_name` containing `Virtual Machine` (Hyper-V's actual value),
  not on `sys_vendor` alone — real Microsoft Surface hardware also
  reports `sys_vendor=Microsoft Corporation` and would otherwise be a
  false positive.

**Deliberately heuristic, like the LD_PRELOAD/Vulkan-layer checks above.**
Running in a VM is completely normal for plenty of legitimate reasons —
cloud gaming, CI, testing, GPU-passthrough streaming rigs — so this never
feeds the ban pipeline on its own: both the one-shot CLI command and the
startup check log at `LOG_WARNING`/`LOG_INFO`, never `LOG_ALERT`/
`LOG_CRIT` (the auto-report hook in `logmsg()` is scoped to
`pri <= LOG_CRIT` specifically so heuristics like this stay visible to an
operator without auto-accumulating as a report against a `client_id`).

**Known, unavoidable limitation.** A hypervisor can be explicitly
configured to hide the CPUID leaf above (VMware's
`hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = FALSE`, VirtualBox's equivalent, KVM/QEMU CPUID
masking) and to override the DMI strings above (QEMU's `-smbios` flag).
That defeats both checks — a property of the technique itself, not a
bug more engineering closes (see `THREAT_MODEL.md`).

### Ban-pipeline reporting (server-side)

Everything above is client-side detection with nowhere for the result to
go. `server/ac_server.py` is a minimal report-ingestion + ban-lookup
service closing that gap — deliberately not an enforcement point, since
this project has no game or matchmaking server to enforce anything against;
it's the API a real one would call.

**Daemon side.** Opt-in via two environment variables passed to
`anticheat start`:

```
AC_REPORT_URL=host:port    # plain HTTP, no scheme -- see TLS note below
AC_REPORT_KEY=<report-key>
```

Unset (the default), reporting is a complete no-op — no network activity
at all. When set, every detection the monitoring loop already logs at
`LOG_ALERT`/`LOG_CRIT` (syscall hook, hidden module, ptrace deny, baseline
tamper, anon-exec growth, render hook — see `logmsg()`) is also POSTed to the server as
`{client_id, event_type, detail, ts}`. `client_id` is `/etc/machine-id`
(falls back to the hostname). A hung or unreachable server can't stall
detection: connect/send/receive are all bounded to 3s (`ac_connect_timeout()`
does a non-blocking connect + `poll()`, since `SO_SNDTIMEO`/`SO_RCVTIMEO`
alone don't bound `connect()` itself on Linux — a host that blackholes SYN
packets rather than refusing them would otherwise hang for the kernel's TCP
retry timeout, not 3s), and a failed or partially-sent report only logs a
local warning, never blocks or crashes the monitoring loop. DNS resolution
via `getaddrinfo()` is not itself timeout-bounded — configure
`AC_REPORT_URL` as a literal IP if that matters for your deployment.

**Unix-domain-socket transport, as an alternative to plain HTTP-over-TCP
(#67).** Set `AC_REPORT_URL=unix:///path/to/socket` instead of
`host:port` to send the exact same HTTP/1.1 request over an `AF_UNIX`
`SOCK_STREAM` socket rather than a network connection — the natural fit
when the daemon and `ac_server.py` are co-located on the same host,
which removes the plaintext-network-credential exposure the "No TLS"
note below describes, since there's no network segment for the
`Authorization: Bearer` key to cross at all. Pair it with `ac_server.py
--unix-socket PATH` (see "Server side" below). Plain `host:port` TCP
keeps working exactly as before — this is an additional option, not a
replacement. See `THREAT_MODEL.md`'s "Unix-domain-socket transport"
note for how this changes the accepted deployment surface (filesystem
permissions on the socket become the trust boundary instead of network
exposure).

**Server side.** Stdlib-only Python (`http.server` + `sqlite3`, zero
third-party dependencies) with two separate bearer-token tiers:

```
POST /report            report-key   -- what the daemon uses
POST /ban               admin-key    -- {client_id, reason}
POST /unban              admin-key   -- {client_id}
GET  /banned/<id>        admin-key   -- what a game server would call
GET  /reports/<id>       admin-key   -- raw reports for a human to review
```

```
AC_SERVER_REPORT_KEY=<report-key> AC_SERVER_ADMIN_KEY=<admin-key> \
    ./server/ac_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --db ac_server.db
```

Both keys are required at startup — it refuses to run with no auth
configured rather than defaulting to open. Client IDs are validated
against a bounded alnum/`.`/`_`/`-` pattern before touching the database;
report bodies are capped at 4 KiB.

Or, to listen on a Unix domain socket instead of TCP (`--host`/`--port`
are ignored when this is set) — the matching daemon-side setting is
`AC_REPORT_URL=unix:///path/to/socket` above:

```
AC_SERVER_REPORT_KEY=<report-key> AC_SERVER_ADMIN_KEY=<admin-key> \
    ./server/ac_server.py --unix-socket /run/anticheat/ac_server.sock --db ac_server.db
```

The socket is created `0600` (owner-only, same reasoning as the DB
file's own permissions), and a stale socket file left behind by a
previous run is unlinked before binding — "stale" is checked, not
assumed: binding refuses to touch the path at all if something's still
listening on it, or if it exists and isn't a socket. That said, `0600`
on the socket file itself only stops someone from opening it — it can't
stop someone who can already write to the socket's *parent directory*
from deleting or replacing the path out from under the server before it
binds. Put the socket in a directory only the server's own user (or
root) can write to, e.g. the `/run/anticheat/` shown above with the
service's own user as owner. `--rate-limit`/`--rate-window` still apply
to every request, but per-source-IP granularity doesn't mean much for a
local socket — every connection over it shares one fixed rate bucket and
is recorded with `source_addr: "unix"` instead of a real peer address,
since there's no per-peer network address to key on; `--trust-proxy`
(below) is a TCP-only concept and is rejected outright alongside
`--unix-socket` — trusting a client-supplied header here would just let
that client forge its own `source_addr`.

**Reports never auto-ban.** A report is a client-side daemon's unverified
claim about itself, running on the exact machine a cheat author controls —
it can be wrong, or spoofed, or replayed by someone probing for false
positives. Accumulated reports are for a human to review (`GET
/reports/<id>`) before deciding to `POST /ban`; auto-banning on
unverified client input would turn a bug or a spoofed report into a
banned real player, which is a worse failure mode than a slower
human-in-the-loop pipeline. This mirrors the same design instinct as
`--hash --save` never auto-creating baselines above.

**Rate limited.** Every endpoint (not just `/report`) is limited per
source IP — `--rate-limit`/`--rate-window`, default 60 requests per 60s —
so a compromised or misbehaving client can't flood the ingestion pipeline
or the SQLite DB, and an attacker can't freely hammer `/banned/<id>` to
enumerate client IDs or brute-force the admin key. It's a simple
fixed-window counter (allows a brief double-rate burst right at a window
boundary), not built for distributed scale — enough to bound abuse
against a single small process, which is the deployment this targets.

**No TLS.** This is plain HTTP, meant for localhost/LAN or behind a
reverse proxy that terminates TLS for anything reachable over an
untrusted network — not a hardened, internet-facing service as shipped.
That's a real gap for a production deployment, not an oversight papered
over: this is the minimal version of the pipeline, not the finished one.
If you do put it behind a reverse proxy, pass `--trust-proxy` plus at
least one `--trusted-proxy-cidr` naming only that proxy (e.g.
`--trusted-proxy-cidr 10.0.0.5/32` for one proxy host) so the rate
limiter and the `source_addr` recorded on every report use the real
client IP (the last, proxy-authored hop of `X-Forwarded-For`) instead of
the proxy's own address. Keep the range as small as possible: every
reachable peer inside it can forge `X-Forwarded-For` outright, so a
broad subnet shared with untrusted clients defeats the allowlist.
`--trust-proxy` without a CIDR refuses to start, and a peer outside the
CIDRs falls back to the raw TCP peer -- off by default, since trusting
that header from anything other than a proxy you control would let a
client spoof both. If the daemon and server are co-located on the same
host, `--unix-socket` (above) sidesteps this gap entirely instead of
working around it — see `THREAT_MODEL.md`'s Unix-domain-socket note.

**Fails closed, not silently.** An uncaught exception in a request
handler (a real disk-full or locked-database error, not just a bad
request) returns a clean `500`, not a dropped connection with no
response — and a client disconnecting mid-response is handled quietly
rather than logged as if it were a bug. `SIGTERM` (what `systemd stop`
and most orchestrators send by default) triggers the same clean shutdown
as Ctrl-C already did; previously only `SIGINT` was handled; and
`SIGTERM`'s default disposition would have hard-killed the process with
no Python cleanup at all.

**Deployment (systemd).** `server/ac_server.service` is a ready-to-copy
unit — dedicated non-root user, `Restart=on-failure`, and a handful of
standard systemd sandboxing directives (`ProtectSystem=strict`,
`NoNewPrivileges=true`, etc. — the process only ever touches its own DB
file and the network). It relies on the `SIGTERM` handling above for a
clean stop/restart, so no `KillSignal=` override is needed. See the
comment block at the top of the file for the install steps.

**TLS.** There's no TLS in `ac_server.py` itself (see "No TLS" above) —
put a reverse proxy in front for anything beyond localhost/LAN and pass
`--trust-proxy` with `--trusted-proxy-cidr` covering that proxy, so rate
limiting and each report's recorded `source_addr` reflect the real client
rather than the proxy. A minimal Caddy config
(automatic cert via Let's Encrypt):

```caddy
ac.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8787
}
```

or nginx, terminating TLS and forwarding with `X-Forwarded-For` appended
(the default behavior of `proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`, which `--trust-proxy`
depends on — see `_client_ip()`'s handling of the header's *last* hop):

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name ac.example.com;
    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/ac.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ac.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

**Key rotation.** `--report-key`/`--admin-key` (and their `AC_SERVER_*`
env-var equivalents) are static for the life of the process — there's no
way to change them without a restart. To avoid a hard cutover where every
daemon and admin client must be updated in lockstep with the server, each
tier also accepts one additional "-old" key (`--report-key-old`/
`--admin-key-old`, or `AC_SERVER_REPORT_KEY_OLD`/`AC_SERVER_ADMIN_KEY_OLD`)
during a rotation window. This is *not* zero-downtime in the connection
sense: `ac_server.service` is a plain `Type=simple` unit with no socket
activation, so `systemctl restart` still stops the listener before
starting the replacement — a request arriving in that gap is refused or
times out like any other brief service restart, same as restarting for
any other reason. What the "-old" key avoids is a *coordinated* cutover:

1. Restart with the *new* key as `--report-key`/`--admin-key` and the
   *current* (about-to-be-retired) key as `--report-key-old`/
   `--admin-key-old`. Both are accepted during this window.
2. Roll every daemon (`AC_REPORT_KEY`) and admin client over to the new
   key.
3. Restart once more without the `-old` flags to finish the rotation.

A key can never be valid for both tiers at once, `-old` included — the
server refuses to start if e.g. `--report-key-old` collides with
`--admin-key` (see the startup check next to `report_keys & admin_keys`).

**Backups.** The `bans` table is the one piece of state that actually
matters operationally (`reports` is useful history but not
authoritative). SQLite's own online backup handles this without stopping
the server, using the external `sqlite3` CLI (a separate package on most
distros — it's not a Python dependency and isn't installed just because
`ac_server.py` imports the stdlib `sqlite3` module):

```sh
sudo install -d -m 0700 -o anticheat -g anticheat /var/lib/anticheat/backups
sqlite3 /var/lib/anticheat/ac_server.db ".backup /var/lib/anticheat/backups/ac_server-$(date +%F).db"
```

The backup directory must exist before the first run — `.backup` fails
with "unable to open database file" if its parent directory is missing,
it won't create one. Run the `sqlite3` line from cron/a systemd timer
once the directory's in place; WAL mode (already enabled — see
`Store._connect()`) means this doesn't block concurrent reads/writes
while it runs.

`server/test_server.sh` exercises the full server (report → review → ban
→ query → unban → query) with no root and no kernel module, and CI runs
it on every push. `test.sh`'s baseline-tamper check additionally starts a
real `ac_server.py` instance and confirms the daemon's report actually
arrives over real HTTP — proof the two sides' wire format agrees, not
just that each compiles.

None of that runs under sustained concurrent load, though, which is what
`server/test_ratelimiter_unit.py` (fast, every push — proves
`RateLimiter._buckets` actually shrinks after `_prune()` runs rather than
growing one entry per distinct source IP forever) and
`server/stress_test.sh` (slower — `$STRESS_CONCURRENCY` workers hammering
`/report` in parallel for `$STRESS_DURATION` seconds, confirming every
successful report lands durably in the DB and the server stays responsive
throughout) cover instead. The latter runs nightly
(`.github/workflows/stress.yml`), not on every push — `STRESS_DURATION=1800
STRESS_CONCURRENCY=50 ./server/stress_test.sh` for a longer soak locally.

## Build

**x86-64 only.** The kernel module hooks `__x64_sys_*`/`__ia32_sys_*` kprobe
symbols specifically, CI only builds/tests against `ARCH=x86_64` kernel trees,
and nothing here has been ported or tested on ARM64 or any other
architecture. This is a stated scope boundary, not an oversight yet to be
noticed as a bug report — porting is unscoped work (see `THREAT_MODEL.md`).

Requires a C compiler for the userspace daemon. The kernel module additionally
needs kernel headers for a kernel **>= 6.12** (it uses `sized_strscpy`, the
`_noprof` allocators, `for_class_mod_mem_type`, and maple-tree VMA iteration);
build it against the headers of the kernel you intend to load it on. The
Makefile auto-detects a clang/LLVM-built kernel (as on Arch/CachyOS) and builds
with the same toolchain.

```sh
make              # builds anticheat.ko + anticheat binary
make daemon       # userspace only
make module       # module only
make test-mock    # run the CLI against the userspace mock (no root needed)
```

### No-root testing: the userspace mock

`make test-mock` (or `./test/mock_test.sh`) runs the entire daemon CLI
against a userspace stand-in for the kernel module:

```sh
LD_PRELOAD=test/libmock_anticheat.so ./anticheat status
```

`test/mock_anticheat.c` intercepts `open`/`ioctl`/`geteuid` via
`LD_PRELOAD` and implements the same ioctl ABI, so every command — status,
protect/list/unprotect, VMA scan, SHA-256 baselines, syscall integrity
(clean **and** compromised), hidden-module detection, events, lock/unlock,
and the monitoring daemon (including graceful SIGTERM shutdown) — is
exercised end-to-end without a kernel module or root. State persists across
CLI invocations in `$AC_MOCK_STATE`; `AC_MOCK_HOOKED=1` simulates a hooked
syscall table, `AC_MOCK_ATTACK=1` simulates a ptrace attack. The mock
always injects one `hidden_rootkit` module to exercise the hidden-module
path.

The mock is a development tool only — it never loads code into the kernel.

### ioctl fuzzing

`make ioctl-fuzz` builds `test/ioctl_fuzz`. Run `./test/ioctl_fuzz` to
hammer every `AC_IOCTL_*` command with malformed sizes, boundary values, and
null/unmapped/wild pointers — the actual attack surface any local
process holding an open fd to `/dev/anticheat` can reach (`ac_ioctl()`'s
own per-call `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` recheck already covers who's allowed to
hold that fd at all — see `priv_drop_test.c` — this is about what a
process that legitimately has it can throw at the interface itself):

```sh
./test/ioctl_fuzz [iterations-per-command] [seed]   # seed always printed, for reproducing a run
```

**Two very different things this can be run against, and they prove
different things:**

- **The mock** — proves the *harness* is correct (calling conventions,
  exercises every ioctl, doesn't crash from its own bugs) and needs no
  root:

  ```sh
  LD_PRELOAD=test/libmock_anticheat.so AC_MOCK_ROOT=1 \
      IOCTL_FUZZ_SAFE_POINTERS_ONLY=1 ./test/ioctl_fuzz
  ```

  `AC_MOCK_ROOT=1` is the same privilege-simulation flag `test-mock`
  above needs — without it the mock's own capability check rejects every
  call before fuzzing even starts. `IOCTL_FUZZ_SAFE_POINTERS_ONLY=1` is
  required here specifically: the mock is plain userspace code with none
  of the kernel's own `copy_from_user()`/`access_ok()` protecting it, so
  a NULL/unmapped/wild pointer crashes the *mock* itself, not the module
  under test; that variant only means something with a real kernel on
  the other end. CI runs exactly this (mock, safe-pointers-only) on
  every push — a dry run, not a kernel-robustness check.
- **A real loaded module, as root** — this is the run that actually
  matters, full pointer-corruption fuzzing included:

  ```sh
  sudo insmod ./anticheat.ko
  sudo ./test/ioctl_fuzz
  ```

  The harness's own exit code only reflects whether *userspace* survived
  — a crashed kernel doesn't necessarily crash the calling process
  cleanly enough to be caught here at all. Check `dmesg` during/after the
  run for any oops, `WARNING`, or lockdep splat; a clean exit with no
  kernel-log findings is the actual pass condition, not just the process
  returning 0. This exact run — root, a real loaded module, no
  `IOCTL_FUZZ_SAFE_POINTERS_ONLY` — is also automated nightly under KASAN
  and lockdep instrumentation; see "KASAN + lockdep boot testing" below.

### KASAN + lockdep boot testing

`.github/workflows/kasan-boot.yml` runs `scripts/kasan_boot_test.sh`
nightly and on-demand (`workflow_dispatch`): it builds a linux-6.12
kernel with `CONFIG_KASAN`/`CONFIG_LOCKDEP`/`CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING`
enabled, boots it in a VM via [virtme-ng](https://github.com/arighi/virtme-ng),
`insmod`s the real `anticheat.ko`, runs the daemon CLI through a basic
smoke sequence, then runs the real ioctl fuzz harness above (full
pointer-corruption fuzzing, no safe-pointers-only) against the real
`/dev/anticheat`. The job captures the VM's console output (which
includes the kernel's own printk/dmesg stream) to a log; it fails if
the in-VM script never reaches its own completion marker (boot, insmod,
or one of the CLI/fuzz steps crashed or hung partway through) or if
that captured log shows a KASAN report, a lockdep splat, or any
oops/warning/general-protection-fault — the same "watch the kernel log,
not the exit code" pass condition as the manual real run above, just
automated, instrumented, and with the additional completion check.

This is nightly, not part of `ci.yml`'s per-push jobs, deliberately:
building a full instrumented kernel and booting it in a VM takes
minutes, and GitHub-hosted runners don't officially or reliably offer
`/dev/kvm` — a per-push gate on that would risk being slow and flaky
rather than a real quality bar. Run it locally the same way CI does:

```sh
./scripts/kasan_boot_test.sh
```

Needs a Linux host (ideally with `/dev/kvm` — falls back to much slower
QEMU/TCG software emulation without it), `virtme-ng`
(`pipx install virtme-ng`, or `pip install virtme-ng` in a venv — recent
distros mark the system Python as externally-managed), `qemu-system-x86`,
and the same kernel build deps the `module` CI job uses (`bc flex bison
libelf-dev libssl-dev dwarves`).

### Load / use

```sh
sudo insmod ./anticheat.ko        # or: sudo modprobe anticheat (after install)
sudo ./anticheat status
sudo ./anticheat protect --pid $(pgrep -x mygame)
sudo ./anticheat scan --pid <pid> --hash --save
sudo ./anticheat start            # run the monitor
```

`sudo make install` installs the binary to `/usr/local/sbin` and the module
to `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/`.

### Automatic rebuild on kernel updates + Secure Boot (DKMS)

`make install` puts a static build in place; it does **not** survive the
next kernel upgrade, and it won't load at all under Secure Boot without a
signature. For a normal desktop distro, use DKMS instead:

```sh
sudo ./scripts/dkms-install.sh
```

This registers the module with DKMS, which rebuilds it automatically every
time a new kernel package is installed. It also installs a small
`/etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/anticheat.conf` fragment that points DKMS's
*built-in* Secure Boot signing at a self-generated Machine Owner Key under
`/var/lib/anticheat/mok/` (DKMS signs every build with it automatically from
then on — no custom signing script needed). The *first* build on a machine
with Secure Boot enabled will ask you to reboot once and approve the key in
the firmware's blue "MOK Management" screen — that's a UEFI requirement (no
software can auto-approve a new trusted key, by design) and only happens
once per machine, not per kernel update.

**Arch Linux / AUR:** `packaging/aur/` has a `hypranticheat`/
`hypranticheat-dkms` split-package `PKGBUILD` that does the same DKMS +
MOK setup as `scripts/dkms-install.sh`, wired into `pacman`'s own
`post_install`/`post_upgrade`/`pre_remove` hooks instead of a manual
script run — see `packaging/aur/README.md`.

**Debian / Ubuntu:** `packaging/debian/` is a `debian/` control directory
(stage it as `debian/` at the repo root to build — see
`packaging/debian/README.md`) producing the same `hypranticheat`/
`hypranticheat-dkms` split, with the DKMS + MOK setup wired into
`postinst`/`prerm` maintainer scripts. Not uploaded to the Debian
archive — build a local `.deb` with `dpkg-buildpackage`.

**Fedora / RPM:** `packaging/fedora/hypranticheat.spec` is a standard
`rpmbuild` spec producing the same split, with the DKMS + MOK setup in
`%post`/`%preun` scriptlets — see `packaging/fedora/README.md`.

The AUR package has been built and verified on a real Arch machine (see
its README); the Debian and Fedora packaging has not yet been run through
a real `dpkg-buildpackage`/`rpmbuild` + install cycle — see the "Not yet
verified" section in each one's README before relying on it.

### SteamOS / Steam Deck / other immutable distros

`/lib/modules` and `/usr` are read-only on SteamOS and get replaced
wholesale on every OTA update, so neither `make install` nor DKMS's
kernel-postinst rebuild hook applies there. Use:

```sh
make install-deck        # installs under ~/.local/share/anticheat
sudo insmod ~/.local/share/anticheat/anticheat.ko
```

This has to be rebuilt and reloaded manually after a SteamOS update (there
is no on-device header package for DKMS to rebuild against); see the
project notes on CI-prebuilding a `.ko` per SteamOS kernel release if you
need this to survive updates unattended.

## Live test

```sh
sudo ./test.sh
```

This loads the module, protects a victim `sleep` process, verifies fork
inheritance, attempts a `strace -p` attach (must be denied), runs scans and
baselines, and verifies lock/unlock semantics.

If a live test (or normal use) ever ends in a crash or hang instead of a
clean result, see `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for how to recognize it, keep the
module from loading again, and collect enough information to file a
useful bug report.

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs two jobs on every push / PR:

1. **Userspace**: `make ci` rebuilds the daemon and mock with
   `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` (zero warnings required) and runs the full mock
test suite — every CLI command, the compromised-syscall-table simulation, the
hidden-module simulation, and the monitoring daemon — with no kernel module
and no root. A separate CI step (not part of `make ci` itself) then runs a
`test/ioctl_fuzz` dry run against the mock
(`IOCTL_FUZZ_SAFE_POINTERS_ONLY=1` — see "ioctl fuzzing" above for why), and
another checks the shell scripts with `shellcheck`.
2. **Kernel module**: fetches a pinned linux-6.12 LTS source tree, prepares
   it (`defconfig` + `scripts` + `modules_prepare`), and builds `anticheat.ko`
   against it. Because a prepared tree has no `Module.symvers`, CI synthesizes
   one from the object's undefined symbols (`KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS`) so the
   final modpost link succeeds; this is a compile smoke test — real load-time
   symbol resolution is validated on a live kernel (see `diag.sh`). The
   resulting `.ko` is uploaded as a build artifact. The same job also runs
   `sparse` (`make C=2`, Kbuild's built-in static-analysis integration,
   reusing the already-prepared tree — no separate fetch) over
   `anticheat_module.c` and fails the build on any finding; the first-ever
   run against this module came back completely clean, so this holds a
   real, verified baseline rather than a hoped-for one.

Separately, `.github/workflows/kasan-boot.yml` runs
`scripts/kasan_boot_test.sh` nightly (plus on-demand via
`workflow_dispatch`) — same "real but heavy, don't gate every push"
treatment `stress.yml` gets: a full KASAN+lockdep kernel build and VM
boot takes minutes, not seconds, and GitHub-hosted runners don't
reliably offer `/dev/kvm`. See "KASAN + lockdep boot testing" above.

To run the same userspace checks locally: `make ci`.

## Design notes & limitations

See [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](THREAT_MODEL.md) for the adversary this defends
against, what's explicitly out of scope, and what "production-ready"
claims today — a single-place compilation of the per-feature limitations
below plus the ones documented earlier in this file (render-hook blind
spots, LD_PRELOAD/Vulkan-layer heuristics, the ban pipeline's no-auto-ban
design).

- **Heuristic, not provably secure.** A determined rootkit with kernel
  privileges can defeat any in-band detector. This tool is defense-in-depth:
  it raises the cost and detects the *typical* hook points.
- The syscall-entry range check treats "inside `[_stext, _etext)` and
  outside all modules" as legit, and on its own can't see a hook that
  redirects within core kernel text (e.g., sys_read → sys_write). The
  boot-time handler-address baseline (`AC_EV_SYSCALL_REDIRECT`, see #63)
  closes most of that gap for a redirect installed *after* the module
  loads, but not against an adversary who already has kernel-write
  privilege equal to or greater than the module's own — such an attacker
  can patch the in-kernel baseline (`ac_syscall_baseline[]`) the same way
  it can patch the table itself, and a redirect already present *before*
  the module's baseline snapshot at load time is captured as normal,
  never flagged. See THREAT_MODEL.md's "Within-core-kernel-text
  redirects" note.
  If the `_stext`/`_etext` kprobe lookups are unavailable (they are section
  labels and not always probe-able), the module derives the text bounds
  from the syscall table entries themselves and falls back to a ±64 MB
  window around a known handler — both cover all legitimate handlers.
- Kernel addresses are KASLR-randomized at boot; kprobe lookups return
  *runtime* addresses, so the table scan uses the live image (no hardcoded
  vmlinux offsets). On x86-64 with IBT the kprobe reports the ftrace call
  site (4 bytes after the `endbr64`), while the syscall table stores the
  symbol start — the module detects `endbr64` (0xf3 0x0f 0x1e 0xfa) and
  normalizes before scanning.
- The `__x64_sys_*`/`__ia32_sys_*` wrappers receive `struct pt_regs *` in
  `%rdi` and unpack the syscall arguments from that frame, so the ptrace
  kprobe reads/rewrites the request in the frame (`args->di`), not in the
  kprobe's own `regs` (which holds the frame pointer).
- The module-list walk races with concurrent module load/unload
  (`module_mutex` is not exported). It is safe (single pass, preemption
  disabled, hard-capped at 1024 entries) but a worst-case snapshot may
  contain a torn entry or miss a module being unloaded at that instant.
- `ac_policy` is read-only at runtime (module param, mode 0600): bit 0 = kill
  ptrace/process_vm offenders (default on). Use
  `sudo insmod anticheat.ko ac_policy=0` to log-and-deny only.
- `lock` pins the module globally, not per-fd: the pin intentionally survives
  the locking process exiting or crashing (that is the point of the panic
  button). If the locking daemon crashes or is killed without unlocking,
  run `sudo ./anticheat unlock` from any privileged shell — it balances the
  global count and releases the reference so `rmmod` succeeds again.
- `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` is rechecked on every ioctl, not just at `open()` — a
  process that opens the device privileged and later drops privileges (a
  normal pattern), or one that receives the fd via `SCM_RIGHTS` or an
  inherited `exec()`, does not retain access once it's no longer
  privileged. `test/priv_drop_test.c` proves this directly: it opens the
  device as root, drops all privileges on the same process while keeping
  the fd open, and confirms the next ioctl is rejected with `-EPERM`
  (`sudo ./test.sh` runs it as part of the live suite).
- ptrace denial works on the standard `__x64_sys_ptrace` /
  `__ia32_compat_sys_ptrace` entries; `process_vm_readv`/`process_vm_writev`
  are covered too, via their
  own native/ia32 kprobes (see "ptrace denial" above). A cheat reaching
  process memory through some other kernel path entirely (not `ptrace(2)`
  or `process_vm_{read,write}v`) is still out of scope for v1.
- Protected pids are matched via the caller's pid namespace by default:
  `protect --pid N` resolves `N` as seen by the daemon itself (normally the
  host/init namespace). This is already correct, with no extra flags, for
  the common case of a sandboxed/containerized game (e.g. Steam's
  pressure-vessel/bwrap) — `/proc` viewed from the daemon's ancestor
  namespace already shows host-visible pids for descendant-namespace
  tasks, and `protect --comm NAME` matches on that view directly. The
  remaining gap is narrower: when a caller only has a *raw in-namespace*
  pid number (no usable comm), `protect --pid N --ns-of REFPID` resolves
  `N` within the pid namespace that host-pid `REFPID` lives in, given any
  other host-resolvable pid known to be in that same namespace as a
  reference point. Prefer `--comm` when a comm name is available; reach
  for `--ns-of` only when it isn't.
- kprobes require `CONFIG_KPROBES` / `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL` (both enabled on
  this kernel). If a probe cannot be registered the module still loads and
  logs the limitation.
- Anonymous-executable detection (`AC_EV_ANON_EXEC`) flags *presence*, not
  *content* — it has no signature scanning and cannot tell injected shellcode
  from a legitimate JIT engine (V8, .NET, JVM) mapping freshly-generated
  machine code the same way. The baseline-delta design (alert only on
  growth after a pid is first observed) keeps `vdso`/`vvar` quiet, but a
  JIT-heavy protected process will still show a legitimately growing count
  over its lifetime — this is a detection *signal* to correlate with other
  evidence, not a standalone verdict. `protect --pid N --jit` (or `--comm
  NAME --jit`) marks a specific protected pid as a known JIT-using binary
  at protect time — per-pid, not by comm name or path, since either of
  those could be spoofed by a cheat process to gain immunity, while
  `protect` itself already requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. Growth on an
  allowlisted pid is still logged (at `LOG_WARNING`, mirroring how
  LD_PRELOAD/Vulkan-layer detection avoids the ban pipeline below), just
  not auto-reported — it's a signal an operator can still see, not one
  that gets silently dropped. Fork inheritance extends this the same way
  it already extends protection itself: a JIT-marked process's children
  inherit the flag too.
- Self-protection (the daemon registers its own pid on startup) only stops
  ptrace-based attacks, via the same kprobe hook everything else uses. It
  does not stop `SIGKILL` from a root-privileged attacker — nothing in this
  design can, without a much larger effort to hide/harden the daemon process
  itself, which brings its own detection-evasion tradeoffs.
- `vmcheck`'s CPUID/DMI hypervisor detection can be defeated outright by a
  hypervisor deliberately configured to hide both signatures (VMware's
  `hypervisor.cpuid.v0 = FALSE`, VirtualBox's equivalent, KVM/QEMU CPUID
  masking, and QEMU's `-smbios` flag for the DMI side) — a fundamental
  limit of any hypervisor-presence check, not a gap more engineering
  closes.
